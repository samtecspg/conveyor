# Basic Installation

We use multiple approaches to getting conveyor running, the majority using Docker. Unless you really like doing things the hard way, or you have special hatred for Docker, we strongly recommend using one of the Docker installs to get yourself running.

#### Pre-requisites

* Docker [Installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (Community Edition, if using recent versions)
* `docker-compose` [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (should be pre-installed for Docker on Mac or Windows)
* Git (installed by default on mac and most linux varieties. To install on windows go [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io))

| Warning  /  Be aware  /  Notice  /  Look out  / etc... |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Running this in docker starts 5 containers, which is a lot. On your system, the default “max ram” for Docker may be too low. Please make sure Docker has a ram max of **at least 4GB** before using Conveyor (this is a known issue using Docker for Mac, and expected on Windows as well) <br> <br> If you receive a message like `conveyor_kibana_1 exited with code 137` then it means you need to give Docker more ram|

### Docker Installation
To get started


```
curl -L -O https://github.com/samtecspg/conveyor/releases/download/v1.0.1/conveyor-5.4.0-v1.0.1.zip
unzip conveyor-5.4.0-v1.0.1.zip
cd conveyor
docker-compose up
```

If all is going well, you should see some output like below:

```
[... LOTS building output ...]
Attaching to conveyor_elasticsearch_1, conveyor_node-red_1, conveyor_api_1, conveyor_kibana_1
[... Lots of log output ...]
kibana_1         | {"type":"log","@timestamp":"2017-10-09T21:10:48Z","tags":["status","plugin:elasticsearch@5.4.0","info"],"pid":1,"state":"green","message":"Status changed from yellow to green - Kibana index ready"
```

Once Kibana is green, you're ready to go!
